# Basics

- Typescript code needs to be transpiled to Javascript code as browsers don't understand TS. TS compilers do this at build stage.
- To install typescript on your machine - `sudo npm i -g typescript`
- To check the version of typescript compiler - `tsc --version`
- To transpile tsc file to js file `tsc main.ts` -> generates .js file and run that using `node main.js` or run together using `tsc main.ts && node main.js`
